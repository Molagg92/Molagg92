### Hi there 👋 My name is Erik Zambrano 

Thank you for visiting my GitHub Profile. Here you will find a history of some of the projects I've worked on, in my career as a developer.

👽️ About Me
---
- 🌱 I am a student at **Epicodus** learning **full-stack web development**, and I am aiming to become a backend specialist. I will graduate in October of 2023. Afterward, I will continue my education by pursuing a **Computer Science degree**.
- 🔭 At the moment I am **finishing up my C# course**, Learning about APIs so I can collaborate with a team for our final week project.
- 👔 I enjoy working with **MySQL server** in **C#**, Testing with **Jest** and **MSTEST** was tricky but very effective at catching errors. For my TeamWeek project for **JavaScript** I very enthusiastically learned to work with **P.5**, and now have picked up **Unity** in my spare time. 
- 🧵 Outside of the Tech World, I have many hobbies. I enjoy listening to **music** from the '90s, watching **bad movies** with my father, and working on my **cardio** when the stress gets to be too much.
